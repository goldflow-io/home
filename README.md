GoldFlow Token (GTF) is a technology collaboration between ThreeFold Tech and NBH Digital EU. Together they will enable a liquid digital gold token; which will enable users to instantly buy and sell gold as well as purchase goods and services.

With every one gram of gold physically deposited in the gold vault, one digital GFT is printed and held in the depositorâ€™s GFT digital wallet. When GFTs are redeemed for physical gold those GTs are burned. Buying, selling and transferring gold will follow all legally necessary KYC/AML requirements. Regular audits will be taken by authorized bodies vouching for the existence of all the gold backing each GFT. This will then be hashed to the blockchain.
Runs on top of TF Grid, uses our blockchain technology
1 gram of gold backed token.
Stored in Denmark and other vaults.
